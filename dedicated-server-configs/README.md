# Additional Steps required for hosting Zombies Dedicated Servers
As of right now you need to take additional Steps to host Zombies Servers.
For Zombie Dedis to work they need to have the Zombies Maps and common FastFiles, these do not come with the UnrankedServer Files. This means you need to copy those over from your installed BO3 game folder.

Copy common fastfiles that is needed for zombies.

```
zone/en_zm_patch.ff
zone/en_zm_common.ff
zone/zm_patch.ff
zone/zm_common.fd
zone/zm_common.ff
zone/zm_levelcommon.ff
```

Now for the map. Shadows of Evil is zm_zod. 

```
zone/en_zm_zod.ff
zone/en_zm_zod_patch.ff
zone/zm_zod.ff
zone/zm_zod_patch.ff
```

from your BO3 Game folder into the UnrankedServer's ```zone``` Folder. Do the same with the FastFiles of the Maps you want to host on the Server, you do not need to copy the .xpak files, those hold Textures and Sounds which the Server doesn't need. You can use the zm_server.cfg as a short name references if you want to grab the others.

You are now ready to start the Server using BOIII_ZM_Server.bat. If the server still instantly closes while opening the BOIII_ZM_Server.bat or BOIII_CP_Server.bat. Check the console_mp.log from identities\dedicatedpc\ folder. Scroll down until you see "Could not find zone: xxxx".
